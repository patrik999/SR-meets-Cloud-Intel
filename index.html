  <title>1st Stream Reasoning meets Cloud-Edge Intelligence Workshop</title>
</head>

<body>
<h2>Aims and Scope</h2>


<p>
After the successful Stream Reasoning workshops in the previous years,
we invite you to a spinoff of the main workshop with a focus on
bringing practitioner and researcher from industry and academia together.
The workshop is <b>invitation-only</b> and will be held at Siemens
Technology in Munich, Germany.
</p>

<p>
  Stream data has become ubiquitous, and the processing, querying, and reasoning over
  streaming data is being studied in different communities such as KRR, Semantic Web,
  Databases, Stream Processing, Complex Event Processing, and Machine Learning.
</p>

<p>
  This event will bring together people working on practical projects, applications and
  tools for stream reasoning and cloud-edge intelligence, spread around different domains,
  from autonomous driving to smart building, data spaces, and industry 4.0. The event will host a series
  of keynotes around the different topics, as well as plenty of time for
  discussions and networking.
